# Ai Voice Assistant
This project is a Python-based AI Voice Assistant with a modern Streamlit interface. It allows users to interact through text and voice commands to perform common tasks like:

🕒 Telling the current time and date

🌦 Fetching real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API

📸 Taking screenshots and saving them locally

🎵 Playing random music on YouTube

🔍 Searching Wikipedia and summarizing results

🎤 Listening to and executing voice commands

🤣 Telling funny jokes to keep you entertained

It combines speech recognition, text-to-speech, and external APIs to provide an interactive and fun personal assistant experience.

# Key Features
